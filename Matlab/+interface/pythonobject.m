classdef pythonobject < dynamicprops
    %PYTHONPROXY Simple concrete dynamicprops subclass used as a container for mirrored methods.
    %   Instances of this class can have properties added at runtime via addprop.

    % No additional code needed; this class exists so we can instantiate
    % a non-abstract dynamicprops-derived object.
